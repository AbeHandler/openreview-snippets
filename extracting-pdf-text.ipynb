      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Interest in visualization has exploded in recent years. Driven in part by the emergence of cheap, ubiquitous data, visualizations are now a common medium for exploring and explaining data produced in the sciences, medicine, humanities, and even our day-to-day lives  [13] . Amongst the huge growth in the number and type of visual analysis tools created for researchers and scholars who want to make sense of complex data, a quickly emerging subclass of visualizations are infographics  [2, 3, 14] . ...\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "For purposes of comparing domains, we delineate visualization practitioners based on their primary skill sets, whether in design or programming. In this work, we study designers whose main expertise is in design. In contrast, we refer to people who primarily create visualizations and visualization creation tools programmatically as visualization programmers. While there are many practitioners who have expertise in both, we find interesting comparisons when individuals have different skill levels...\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS\n",
      "The data we collected comes from several sources: observations of designers in controlled, observational studies; observations of designers working on teams in situ at a design hackathon; and a series of unstructured and semistructured interviews. For each observation and interview we took notes, voice recordings, and collected design artifacts when appropriate -the voice recordings were later transcribed, and the artifacts are available in the Supplemental Material. We organized the raw data ar...\n",
      "\n",
      "Observational studies\n",
      "We designed our observational studies to better understand how designers work with data. These studies centered around two datasets that we prepared, inspired by existing infographics  [23, 34]  -these datasets are included in the Supplemental Material. The first is a time-travel dataset depicting years traveled in popular movies. The dataset is tabular with the rows representing a time-travel trip in a movie, and the columns consisting of the movie title, movie release year, and the start and s...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hackathon\n",
      "We also observed two teams consisting of both designers and programmers at a three-day data visualization hackathon. The hackathon provided an opportunity to observe designers working in a real-world setting, as well as in a team environment. Each hackathon team was created organically, with participants choosing their own team, data sources, and objectives, reducing the potential bias due to lack of motivation and engagement typical in lab studies  [30] . One team chose to work with FitBit acti...\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviews\n",
      "We conducted a series of unstructured and semistructured interviews with designers both in person and over Skype. The interviews included questions about the designers' design process, how working with data influenced their design process, and the types of tools used....\n",
      "\n",
      "PATTERNS\n",
      "From an analysis of the data that we collected from our observations and interviews, we identified twelve emergent patterns of how designers work with data to create infographics. Below we break these patterns into three classes: how the designers approached data, how data affected the designers and their work process, and alternatives to manual encoding of data that the designers employed. Each specific pattern is stated in bold and numbered....\n",
      "\n",
      "How designers approached data\n",
      "In our observational studies we observed all of the designers initially sketching visual representations of data on paper, on a whiteboard, or in Illustrator. In these sketches, the designers would first draw high-level elements of their design such as the layout and axes, followed by a sketching in of data points based on their perceived ideas of data behavior (P1). An example is shown in Figure  3 . The designers often relied on their understanding of the semantics of data to infer how the dat...\n",
      "\n",
      "How data affects designers\n",
      "We observed that while the designers frequently refined the nondata visual elements of their designs, such as color and font choices, the design of their data encodings remained unchanged until assumptions about data behavior were shown to be incorrect (P8). For example, in the time travel study T3 introduced curves into her design after encountering the incompatibility of one movie in her initial design. Similarly both T1 and T2 made changes to their designs after discovering one of the outlier...\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatives to manual encoding\n",
      "We observed some designers using external tools to encode the data into a chart and we discussed this process in several interviews. In our observational studies we saw two designers copy charts from Excel into Illustrator, while a third commented that she wished she could follow this pattern: \"I would rather make [Excel] do this for me... [but] I don't know how -and it's not as pretty.\" In all cases where this technique was observed or discussed, however, the designers still performed downstrea...\n",
      "\n",
      "THEMES\n",
      "The observed patterns reveal four themes. First, manual encoding is acceptable when the tradeoff is flexibility, and is a form of data exploration. Second, designers prefer to place data on existing graphics instead of generating graphics directly from data. Third, to support flexibility, operations should be commutative. Finally, tool creators should be aware of designers' struggles to define and modify data abstractions. These themes have interesting implications for two known challenges in th...\n",
      "\n",
      "Manual encoding has its benefits\n",
      "Our observations and interviews point to a clear trend that manual encoding is not only tolerated, but even embraced by designers in order to maintain flexibility and richness in the design process. This finding is in juxtaposition with the motivations and goals of many visualization creation tools that strive to ease the burden of encoding data by limiting the design space and enforcing an order of operations. Even in situations where designers use external tools to encode data, this step was j...\n",
      "\n",
      "Placing data on existing graphics\n",
      "While automated visualization generators provide ease of use, efficiency, and sometimes support user-specification of the look and feel of marks, these features come at the expense of flexibility  [13] : the underlying visual representations are all predefined or selected via a gui. Instead, designers told us they want to be able to create something new and novel. Visualization programming environments also have benefits in that they provide more flexibility, but they require the representation ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Relaxing the sequence of processing\n",
      "We found that the designers we observed and interviewed avoid tools that enforce a process (P12). This supports the idea that designers prefer a flexible design environment that does not enforce a specific order of operations. Consistent with what others have observed  [41] , the order in which designers will perform various operations can not, and perhaps even should not, be anticipated; instead visualization design environments could support a workflow with a flexible sequence. Changes in one ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating an effective data abstraction\n",
      "As designers with data experience are aware (P4), designers have a critical need to be able to define and modify data abstractions. This is important for two reasons. First, the time spent planning or implementing ineffective or incompatible visualizations can be reduced by understanding data behavior (P2) and structure (P3) early on in the design process. And second, variety in design is increased when the data behavior (P8) and structure (P9) are well understood. Others have shown that variety...\n",
      "\n",
      "OPPORTUNITIES\n",
      "These themes expose rich opportunities for visualization creation tools. One is to separate the processes of visual encoding and data binding so that manual visual encoding is allowed, but data connections are maintained. Granting designers direct control over what data bindings exist could liberate them to follow any order of operations in their process: similar to existing approaches, they could create visual elements from data. Alternatively, they could first create visual elements, and later...\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n",
      "In this paper we present an observational study, as well as a set of interviews, about how designers design with data. The observations include exercises with prepared data sets in the lab and observations of designers working as teams in the wild. From these observations and interviews we extract a set of patterns that support themes that have implications for data abstraction and visual representation challenges. While these challenges are well-known to visualization programmers, the design pe...\n",
